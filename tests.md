# Tribe Common tests

This is a brief and quick guide that's covering the bare essentials needed to set up the tests on your local plugin copy.
Please refer to [Codeception](http://codeception.com/docs) and [WP Browser](https://github.com/lucatume/wp-browser) documentation for any issue that's not TEC related.

## Set up
After cloning the TEX repository on your local machine change directory to the plugin root folder and pull in any needed dependency using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

	composer update
	
Todo: this guide has to be re-written to suite our set up.
